The project aims to shed light on Adidas's retail operations as they stand today by carefully examining important indicators to identify both the company's strong points and potential improvement areas. We hope to provide Adidas with vital guidance that will allow it to improve its business operations by closely examining profitability and sales performance.
In the end, our primary goal is to give Adidas a road map for skillfully negotiating the cutthroat landscape of the athletic wear industry. By providing strategic advice and insights, we hope to enable Adidas to improve productivity, encourage expansion, and forge a future of long-term success in the fiercely competitive market.
